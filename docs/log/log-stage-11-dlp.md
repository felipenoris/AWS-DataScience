## 2026-10-17 — step 2.1.1, the organization analyzer read and triaged

- **[user] The Audit snapshot.** `aws/cloudshell/audit-iam-analyser.sh` ran in Audit's CloudShell at
  23:38:36Z under `AWSAdministratorAccess`, and its output was attached in the Claude project's thread
  "Esqueleto do threat model". The file carries account ids and stays out of git.
- **[Claude] Sections 2, 3, 5 and 6.** CHECK OK: one analyzer, `awsds-org-external-access`,
  `ORGANIZATION`, `ACTIVE`, created 2026-08-12T03:38:38Z, the five project tags, no archive rule, last
  resource analyzed at 23:10:48Z (`awsds-prod-tfstate`); no call failed. `INV-10` holds.
- **[Claude] Section 4 counts 49 findings, all `ExternalAccess`: 46 `ACTIVE`, 3 `RESOLVED`.** 45 of the
  active ones are `AWSReservedSSO_*` roles, one per assignment-backed permission set per account:

  | Account | Active role findings | Beyond A.1's class rows |
  |---|---|---|
  | Management | 5 | none |
  | Audit | 3 | none |
  | Log Archive | 3 | none |
  | Policy Canary | 4 | none |
  | Identity | 4 | none |
  | Data Governance | 5 | `GovernanceManagerAccess` |
  | Production | 7 | `DataScientistProdAccess`, `DeploymentManagerAccess`, `DevEnvStewardAccess` |
  | Sandbox Account 1 | 7 | `DataScientistAccess`, `DeploymentManagerAccess`, `DevEnvStewardAccess` |
  | Staging | 7 | `DataScientistStagingAccess`, `DeploymentManagerAccess`, and the direct `AWSAdministratorAccess` an account update re-created on 2026-09-06 |

  That is the 35 of 2026-08-15, the nine persona rows of `identity/sso`'s `local.assignments` and
  Staging's direct assignment: `INV-16`'s shape, restated in `docs/AWS_STATE.md`.
- **[Claude] The three `RESOLVED` findings are in Staging**: the `DevEnvStewardAccess` and
  `DataScientistAccess` roles whose assignments Stage 6b step 2.1 removed on 2026-09-06, and the KMS key
  `ef2e17cd-…`, which no document here names. That it is the Development project key 6b destroyed
  (`PendingDeletion` until 2026-10-06) is inferred.
- **[Claude] One `ACTIVE` finding has another shape: the KMS key `a81b1ef3-…` in Sandbox Account 1**,
  `alias/awsds-sandbox-project` (the id [`log-stage-06i`](log-stage-06i-sandbox-orchestration.md)
  records). Two statements of its policy, written by `terraform-modules/sagemaker-prereqs/kms.tf`,
  grant `Principal: {"AWS": "*"}` under conditions that bound neither the caller's account nor its
  organization: `GrantKMSPermissionsForAllProjectRoles` and `AllowCreateGrantForProjectRoles`. Which
  of them the finding carries is inferred, since the summary names neither. Outside the organization the
  RCP's `EnforceOrgIdentitiesOnSecretsAndKeys` denies `kms:*`, read and never attempted, and an external
  finding does not weigh an RCP (AWS's `ExternalAccessDetails` reference, read 2026-10-17), so the
  finding stands with the RCP in place. Recorded as `TM-21` in
  [`threat-model.md`](../plan/threat-model.md) and as `EXC-18`; the user chooses between narrowing the
  two statements and archiving the finding individually.
- **[Claude] No finding names an S3 bucket**: not the lake's five, not `awsds-sandbox-smus-projects`,
  not `awsds-sandbox-lake`. None names the lake's data CMK `alias/awsds-data-data`, Sandbox's
  `alias/awsds-sandbox-data`, a function, a topic, a snapshot or a file system. The threat model's
  outside column is filled from this reading.

## 2026-10-18 — `TM-21`: the Sandbox project key's narrowing chosen

Written by Claude in the cloud session of the project thread, with no AWS identity, in PR #164; nothing
changed in AWS.

- **[user] The choice** (00:02:46, on a card): narrow the project key policy's two
  `Principal: {"AWS": "*"}` statements to this organization's principals, rather than archive the
  finding individually.
- **[Claude] What the change waits on.** The statement the finding carries, which `get-finding-v2` in
  Audit names, asked of the user at 00:03:35. And Stage 17's pass 1 (PR #157), which moves the same
  module, `terraform-modules/sagemaker-prereqs/`, to `v0.5.0`, a tag not yet on origin: the narrowing
  is the module's next tag after it, read from `git ls-remote --tags origin` when it is tagged, and its
  `sandbox/sagemaker/` apply runs from the laptop. `TM-21` and `EXC-18` stay open until a snapshot
  reads the finding `RESOLVED`.

## 2026-10-18 — `TM-21`: the finding read by `get-finding-v2`

- **[user] The finding's detail**, read in Audit's CloudShell with the commands asked at 00:03:35 and
  pasted in the thread at 00:18:51:

  ```bash
  ANALYZER=$(aws accessanalyzer list-analyzers --region us-west-2 --query "analyzers[?name=='awsds-org-external-access'].arn" --output text)
  ID=$(aws accessanalyzer list-findings-v2 --region us-west-2 --analyzer-arn "$ANALYZER" --filter '{"resourceType":{"eq":["AWS::KMS::Key"]},"status":{"eq":["ACTIVE"]}}' --query 'findings[0].id' --output text)
  aws accessanalyzer get-finding-v2 --region us-west-2 --analyzer-arn "$ANALYZER" --id "$ID" --query '[resource, findingDetails]' --output json
  ```

  The output, with the account id replaced by the account's name:

  ```json
  [
      "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:<Sandbox Account 1>:key/a81b1ef3-716f-4105-bb42-14184a6e2174",
      [
          {
              "externalAccessDetails": {
                  "action": [
                      "kms:CreateGrant",
                      "kms:Decrypt",
                      "kms:GenerateDataKey"
                  ],
                  "condition": {},
                  "isPublic": true,
                  "principal": {
                      "AWS": "*"
                  },
                  "resourceControlPolicyRestriction": "APPLICABLE"
              }
          }
      ]
  ]
  ```

- **[Claude] Both statements carry the finding.** Its three actions are the union of
  `GrantKMSPermissionsForAllProjectRoles` (`kms:GenerateDataKey`, `kms:Decrypt`) and
  `AllowCreateGrantForProjectRoles` (`kms:CreateGrant`), and its principal is theirs. The analyzer
  reads the key as public (`isPublic: true`) and weighs neither statement's conditions as bounding
  (`condition: {}`); `APPLICABLE` is the RCP present and left out of the evaluation. That an
  `aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition on both statements resolves the finding is inferred: no AWS page read
  here says how the analyzer weighs it on a key, and the snapshot after the apply decides it. AWS's key
  permissions for the Tooling blueprint, the contract `kms.tf` adapts, give both statements without an
  account or organization condition and do not mention Access Analyzer (read 2026-10-18). The change
  now waits only on Stage 17's pass 1 (PR #157).
