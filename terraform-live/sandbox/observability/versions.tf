# Version pin - Stage 2 step 1. The same constraint every slice carries.
#
# Terraform has no repository-wide pin: the constraint belongs to each root module, so these lines
# are repeated per slice (Lesson 14). scripts/check-provider-locks.py compares required_version and
# the hashicorp/aws constraint against sandbox/foundation's. One provider: everything here is
# CloudWatch.
