# The provider. Same shape as every slice (Stage 2 step 2.1): region from the generated tfvars,
# the five mandatory tags as default_tags, CostCenter naming the stage that created the resources.
#
# The wrong-account guard is the backend: this slice's state lives in this account's own
# awsds-<env>-tfstate, which admits no cross-account principal. One read crosses an account boundary:
# the deploy runner's home identity, for the trust of the test deploy role (deploy-role.tf's alias);
# a project role, the policies it gets and the jobs it names are all in this one account.
