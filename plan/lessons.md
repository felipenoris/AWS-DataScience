# Lessons carried forward

**The one file here whose content is not recoverable from anywhere else.** These are findings from the
planning period that re-reading the plan will not give back. Add to this list only what would otherwise
be relearned the hard way.

Read it before planning, reviewing, or settling a decision. `CLAUDE.md` carries the fifteen titles so a
lesson can be *recognised* without opening this file; the reasoning that makes each one usable is here.

1. **A copy of governed data landing somewhere less governed is not a hole to be closed.** It is a
   property of every SageMaker installation, not something D18 introduced. The control is the data
   perimeter (`plan/architecture.md` §4.2), which stops the copy leaving the organization; preventing the copy was never the
   control. The first answer given on this got it wrong and treated it as a newly opened gap.
2. **A stand-in that shares an account with the thing it de-risks proves nothing about permissions.** A
   `staging` Glue namespace *inside* Production was once invented to substitute for a Staging account: it
   shared an IAM surface and a blast radius with its own subject, so it could catch a schema error and
   never a permission error — which is the failure class a cross-account promotion actually produces.
   That is why D20 exists.
3. **When a decision moves a resource across an account boundary, re-check every condition that
   referenced it — especially conditions pointing at ephemeral things.** This nearly shipped: Stage 5
   pinned the Data Governance bucket policies to the consumers' `aws:SourceVpce`, but interface endpoints
   are `[E]` (new IDs on every `make up`) and since D22 live in a *different* account, so nothing would
   ever repair them. Anchor on the `[P]` S3 **gateway** endpoint, or on `aws:SourceVpc`.
4. **State that lives only inside an `[E]` resource is this design's recurring failure mode** (`plan/conventions.md` §5.1 rule
   2). Three hits already — EFS, the Studio domain, MWAA's metadata database — and it will recur for
   every stateful service considered for the `make up`/`make down` cadence. Check it before adopting one.
5. **An intention is not a control.** "No compute in Data Governance" was written down for a whole
   revision before anyone noticed the `Data` OU SCP never denied Glue jobs (D25). Likewise the three Lake
   Formation shares assumed organization-wide RAM sharing and cross-account version 3+ that no stage
   enabled — and their absence makes a share fail *silently*, the grant succeeding while the resource
   never appears. For every stated property, name the policy line that enforces it.
6. **Prices are measured, not reasoned.** The AWS Price List bulk API
   (`pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/<service>/current/<region>/index.json`) is public,
   needs no credentials, and answers in seconds what the pricing pages answer in paragraphs. It is also
   how a *missing component* was found rather than a price difference — CodeArtifact does not exist in
   `sa-east-1` — which the Region check done by reading had missed. `PRICING.md` is built this way.
7. **A rejected-on-cost option goes stale in the direction that flatters the rejection.** The D7 table
   ruled MWAA out on a standing-cost floor that `mw1.micro` and MWAA Serverless had since removed.
   Re-check the price and the shape of any service the plan rejected on cost before acting on it. The
   same pattern closed D26 a day later: Unified Studio was rejected partly for having no IaC path, and
   official Terraform support had arrived (2026-07) before the rejection was ever acted on.
8. **When the classic `aws` provider lacks a resource, check the CloudFormation registry and `awscc`
   before declaring a Terraform gap.** `AWS::MWAAServerless::Workflow` existed, and `awscc` exposes
   every registry type mechanically — the "open issue, no branch" on the classic provider was the wrong
   place to look. The `aws-ia` Unified Studio module itself splits the same way: domain via `aws`,
   projects and blueprints via `awscc`.
9. **The axis question applies to people as well as to resources.** The same pass that moved the domain
   onto the ownership axis split the `Manager` persona along it: **Deployment Manager** (lifecycle —
   approves releases) and **Governance Manager** (ownership — approves data access). This had been
   written into `plan/institutional-delta.md` as "what an institution would do, notational here" a few hours earlier, and that was
   wrong: with one persona, a single human writes a job that reads restricted data, approves its release
   **and** approves its access to that data. Three acts, one signature. Never assign one person to both
   groups. The related trap: the governance manager must **not** have blanket read on the data they gate
   — an approver who can already read everything is not exercising a control.
10. **Before placing a new resource in an account, ask which axis it is on — and check whether a
   *registry* is being confused with a *runtime*.** D26's first draft put the Unified Studio domain in
   Development because that is where people work. Wrong: a domain holds projects, profiles, blueprints
   and the catalog, while blueprints provision the compute into whichever account the profile names. It
   is an ownership-axis resource and belongs with the catalog it governs (which is also what makes
   subscription fulfilment a *local* Lake Formation grant). The recurring symptom of getting this wrong
   is the question "so is that a production account?" — the honest answer is that off-axis accounts are
   not production, they are cross-cutting, and some of them are high blast radius instead.
11. **A decision that changes *who authors* an IAM policy invalidates every claim made about that policy.**
   Lesson 3 is about resources crossing an account boundary; this is the same failure one level up. D13's
   entire force is "the execution role holds no S3 on registered prefixes" — a sentence that was true
   because *we wrote the role*. D26 handed role authorship to a blueprint and nobody re-read D13 for a
   whole revision. The general form: when adopting a managed or opinionated service, list which resources
   it will now create on your behalf, and re-read every decision whose enforcement depends on one of them.
   INT-15 exists because of this.
12. **An edition or tier limit can reach a load-bearing control, not just a convenience.** The plan caught
   that GitLab CE lacks SAML group sync and correctly filed it as an annoyance. It did not notice that the
   *approval gate* — the thing D20's entire argument rests on — is the same kind of paid feature, so the
   lab's gate constrains "who can push a protected tag" rather than "who approves this release". Check the
   tier of every product feature a *control* depends on, separately from the features the workflow merely
   prefers.
13. **A verification command that returns empty on both success and failure is not a verification.** Stage
   1b's deliverable proposed `aws ram get-resource-share-associations` as the proof that organization-wide
   sharing was enabled; with no share yet created it returns an empty list in both cases. This is the
   detection-side twin of Lesson 5: an intention is not a control, and a command that cannot fail is not a
   check. Before writing a deliverable, ask what its output looks like when the thing is *broken*.

14. **A blanket carve-out written by hand across several policies is a control that will be missing from
   one of them.** D30 adopted a principal exempt from every custom `Deny`. The dangerous part is not the
   exemption — that was a deliberate, argued trade — it is that the *same condition* has to appear in every
   statement, and a set where three policies carry it and the fourth does not is one nobody can reason
   about, with no error to tell you which. Two consequences generalise beyond this decision: any condition
   that must appear in N places gets **generated, not typed** (which is what finally forced the SCPs into
   Terraform, a gap that had sat unowned since Stage 1b was written); and any ARN condition gets an
   **enumerated list, never a wildcard account** — `arn:aws:iam::*:role/x` means "anyone who can create a
   role named x, anywhere". Both traps are invisible in a `plan` and cheap in CI.
15. **Recommending against something is not the same as it being wrong, and the record should show which
   happened.** D30 was recommended against and adopted anyway, for reasons that hold: fixing in place keeps
   repairs out of the Management console, and the pattern's sharp edges are worth building once in a lab
   whose stated purpose (`plan/institutional-delta.md`) is to learn patterns. The useful discipline is to write the trade-off into the
   decision rather than re-argue it, then spend the effort on the mitigations — which is where the real
